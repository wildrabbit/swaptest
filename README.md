# Fruit 3

Fruit 3 is a simple match-3 game project developed in Unity.

### Controls: 
The game is controlled using mouse clicks.

Drag a fruit into a contiguous one to attempt a swap. 
Alternately, you can tap on a fruit to select it, then tap a second time on an adjacent one to attempt the swap. Tapping outside the grid will cancel the selection, and tapping on a non-adjacent fruit will change the selected fruit.
